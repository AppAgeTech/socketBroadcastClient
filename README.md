# WebRTC Video/Audio Broadcast

WebRTC PeerToPeer broadcast application that allows the broadcaster to send video and audio stream to all connected users (watchers). 

You can find the tutorial that explains the code and functionality on my [website](https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/webrtc-video-broadcast).

## Getting started

### Starting the application

Start the application using Node:

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the server
node server
```

Start the application using Docker:

```bash
# Building the image
docker build --tag webrtcvideobroadcast .

# Run the image in a container
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 webrtcvideobroadcast
```

### Testing the application

The application should now be running on your localhost:4000 and you test it by connecting to localhost:4000/broadcast to add a new broadcaster.

After that, you just need to visit localhost:4000 to connect to the server as a client and you should get the video that is streamed from the broadcaster.
